# 👋 Hi, I’m Tejasvi Sadasivuni (@tejasvigit)
I have completed
### Courses: Python Programming, Statistics, Data Analysis & Visualization, Machine Learning, SQL & Analytics

### Highlights: 600+ hours of coursework, 10 coding assignments, 3 projects (Web scraping, EDA, Machine Learning)

### My Projects

## Exploratory Data Analysis of 2+ Million Crime Dataset : [Link](https://jovian.ai/tejasvi-sadasivuni/eda-project-tejasvi-sadasivuni#C60)

* Cleaned data for 2+ million containing 27 columns, then condensing down to just under 800k rows.
* Created visualizations (scatterplots, bar charts and geospatial mapping) using Seaborn, Plotly and Folium
* Found that homicides doubled in 2020 compared to the average of the 18 years prior. Location analysis showed some zip codes closer to the town center as having higher number of crimes. But this could be due to the fact that these zip codes were populated well before the surrounding areas were urbanized.


## Machine Learning - Reducing Commercial Aviation Fatalities [Link](https://jovian.ai/tejasvi-sadasivuni/project-3-machine-learning-reducing-commercial-aviation-fatalities)
* Cleaned data for training dataset with 4 million rows and test dataset with 18million rows with python (Pandas)
* Tested multiple algorithms to improve prediction accuracy
* With an XGB classifier algorithm a multiclass log loss of 0.695 was achieved, putting me at a ranking of 39 / 178

## Web scraping stock prices on Yahoo stock market
* Utilized Beautifulsoup package of python to draw relevant data from HTML code
* Scraped over 200 markets and classified them into various categories and saved as notepad files (.csv)
